## Technical Implementation

### AI Path Generation

1. **Search GitHub** - Find top repositories for topic
2. **AI Analysis** - Analyze repos and create structure
3. **Level Assignment** - Categorize repos by difficulty
4. **Learning Objectives** - Generate specific "what to learn"
5. **Time Estimation** - Calculate realistic timeframes
6. **Skills Extraction** - Identify key skills
7. **Project Ideas** - Suggest practice projects

### Progress Tracking

**MongoDB Schema:**
```typescript
{
  email: string,
  topic: string,
  pathId: string,
  completedSteps: string[],
  currentStep: number,
  totalSteps: number,
  progress: number,
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

**Progress Calculation:**
```
progress = (completedSteps.length / totalSteps) * 100
```

### AI Prompt Engineering

The system uses a sophisticated prompt that:
- Analyzes available repositories
- Creates logical progression
- Generates specific learning objectives
- Estimates realistic timeframes
- Suggests relevant projects
- Structures output as JSON
