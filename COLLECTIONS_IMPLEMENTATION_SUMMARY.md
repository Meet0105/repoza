- ‚úÖ `pages/api/collections/[id]/repos.ts` - Add/remove repos from collection
- ‚úÖ `pages/api/collections/export.ts` - Export all collections as JSON

### Frontend

- ‚úÖ `COLLECTIONS_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - This file

## Features Implemented

### ‚ú® Core Features
1. **Create Collections** - Users can create custom collections with names and descriptions
2. **Add Repos to Collections** - Heart icon on every repo card for quick adding
3. **Remove Repos** - Easy removal from collections
4. **Edit Collections** - Update collection names and descriptions
5. **Delete Collections** - Remove collections with confirmation
6. **View Collections** - Beautiful UI to browse all collections
7. **Export Collections** - Download all collections as JSON file
8. **Multi-Collection Support** - Add repos to multiple collections

### üé® UI/UX Features
- Heart icon on repo cards (only for logged-in users)
- Modal for selecting collections
- Create collection inline while adding repo
- Visual feedback (checkmarks for added repos)
- Responsive design
- Smooth animations
- Pink/rose color theme for collections

### üîí Security
- All endpoints require authentication
- Users can only access their own collections
- Session-based auth via NextAuth
- Proper error handling

## How It Works

### User Flow
1. User finds interesting repo
2. Clicks heart icon on repo card
3. Modal opens showing all collections
4. User selects collection(s) or creates new one
5. Repo is instantly added
6. User can view all collections at `/collections`

### Technical Flow
1. Frontend calls `/api/collections` to get user's collections
2. User adds repo ‚Üí POST to `/api/collections/[id]/repos`
3. MongoDB stores repo object in collection's repos array
4. Real-time UI updates with checkmarks
5. Collections page displays all saved repos

## Database Schema

```typescript
Collection {
  _id: ObjectId
  email: string              // User identifier
  name: string               // Collection name
  description: string        // Optional description
  repos: Array<RepoObject>   // Array of GitHub repo objects
  isPublic: boolean          // For future sharing feature
  createdAt: Date
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/collections` | Get all user collections |
| POST | `/api/collections` | Create new collection |
| GET | `/api/collections/[id]` | Get single collection |
| PUT | `/api/collections/[id]` | Update collection |
| DELETE | `/api/collections/[id]` | Delete collection |
| POST | `/api/collections/[id]/repos` | Add repo to collection |
| DELETE | `/api/collections/[id]/repos` | Remove repo from collection |
| GET | `/api/collections/export` | Export all collections |

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing
- [ ] Login to Repoza
- [ ] Search for a repo
- [ ] Click heart icon on repo card
- [ ] Create new collection from modal
- [ ] Add repo to collection
- [ ] Go to Collections page (`/collections`)
- [ ] View collection contents
- [ ] Edit collection name
- [ ] Remove repo from collection
- [ ] Delete collection
- [ ] Export collections
- [ ] Add same repo to multiple collections

### What to Test
1. **Authentication** - Only logged-in users see heart icon
2. **Create Collection** - Can create with name and description
3. **Add Repo** - Repo appears in collection immediately
4. **Remove Repo** - Repo removed when unchecked
5. **Edit Collection** - Name and description update correctly
6. **Delete Collection** - Collection removed completely
7. **Export** - JSON file downloads with correct data
8. **UI/UX** - Smooth animations, no glitches
9. **Error Handling** - Graceful errors if MongoDB fails

## Next Steps (Future Enhancements)

### Phase 2 Features
1. **Public Collections** - Share collections with others via link
2. **Collection Templates** - Pre-made collections for common use cases
3. **Collaborative Collections** - Multiple users can contribute
4. **Import Collections** - Import from JSON file
5. **Collection Search** - Search within collections
6. **Smart Collections** - Auto-add repos based on criteria
7. **Collection Analytics** - Track most saved repos
8. **Bulk Operations** - Add multiple repos at once
9. **Collection Tags** - Additional organization
10. **Collection Cover Images** - Visual customization

### Technical Improvements
- Add pagination for large collections
- Implement caching for better performance
- Add sorting options (by stars, date added, etc.)
- Implement drag-and-drop reordering
- Add collection statistics
- Optimize MongoDB queries with indexes

## Usage Example

```typescript
// User searches for "react dashboard"
// Finds awesome repo
// Clicks heart icon

// Modal opens:
// - "React Projects" (5 repos) ‚úì
// - "Work Stuff" (12 repos)

// + Create New Collection

// User clicks "React Projects"
// Checkmark appears
// Repo is saved!

// Later, user goes to /collections
// Sees all their organized repos
