## Troubleshooting

### Heart Icon Not Showing
- **Issue:** Heart icon doesn't appear on repo cards
- **Solution:** Make sure you're logged in. Icon only shows for authenticated users.

### Can't Add Repo to Collection
- **Issue:** Error when adding repo
- **Solution:** Check MongoDB connection. Ensure user is authenticated.

### Collections Not Loading
- **Issue:** Collections page shows loading forever
- **Solution:** Check MongoDB connection and API endpoint `/api/collections`

### Export Not Working
- **Issue:** Export button doesn't download file
- **Solution:** Check browser permissions for downloads. Try different browser.

## Best Practices

### Naming Collections
- Use descriptive names: "React Admin Dashboards" not "Stuff"
- Be specific: "Next.js E-commerce Templates" not "Templates"
- Use categories: "Learning - Python", "Work - APIs"

### Organizing Repos
- Create collections by technology, purpose, or project
- Don't create too many collections (5-15 is ideal)
- Use descriptions to clarify collection purpose
- Regularly review and clean up collections

### Performance Tips
- Keep collections under 50 repos for best performance
- Export collections regularly as backup
- Delete unused collections

## Security

### Authentication
- All endpoints require authentication
- Users can only access their own collections
- Session-based authentication via NextAuth

### Data Privacy
- Collections are private by default
- No public access without explicit sharing (future feature)
- User email is used as identifier
